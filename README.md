# Face Recognition - iOS

## Project Idea

**The main idea of this project is to recognize the person properly, then communicate with ESP32 device via Bluetooth and send a signal that the authentication has happened correctly. In our case, it is turning the LED ON when authentication is correct and turning the LED OFF when it is not.**

## How to run the app

**1. Clone this repo**

**2. Open the Xcode project on Mac computer**

**3. Select the development team by going to "face_ai" on the Navigator window -> Select Signing & Capabilities -> Select your team**

**If you do not have one, you need to open Xcode preferences -> Accounts -> Add your Apple ID, then click Manage Certificates -> Click "+" button -> Apple Development**

**Finally you may have to change your "Bundle Identifier" (it is under "Team" in Signing & Capabilities settings) to whatever you want**

**4. Plugin iPhone to the Mac**

**5. Choose connected iPhone from available devices**

**6. Hit Run button**

**7. Trust the developer on the iPhone by going to Settings -> General -> Profiles & Device Management**
